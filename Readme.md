#TimeTracker

TimeTracker is (surprisingly) a time tracking tool to help developers log what they do in order 
to fill in an external Timesheet.

It's primary use is for providing help when filling in a Tempo timesheet in Jira.

It will help by:
- Tracking the active program running on the machine
- Showing calendar information from Outlook
- Showing calendar information from Google

It'll also allow the user to provide their own info about what they're doing at any
one moment. Including by picking from a list of their current (or any) jira tickets
