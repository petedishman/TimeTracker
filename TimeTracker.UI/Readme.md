TimeTracker UI

How should this work then?

Basically, I guess it's got to be pretty similar to tptmtrack as we're basically doing the same.
For each time period, we need to showw what we logged at that time and let you log something specific.

We also need some way of specifying the userhint/picking a jira ticket
